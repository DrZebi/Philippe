/*

Muno's Words of Wisdom: Due to a Certified Dan Moment, you must duplicate the
last frame of your crouch animation. So like, if your animation has 10 frames
total, add an 11th that's the copy of the 10th. You do NOT include this 11th
frame in the crouch_recovery_frames or etc; configure these values AS IF there
were only 10 frames.

The reason for this is that otherwise, the crouch just glitches out at the end
of the standing-up animation. Dan Moment
